A starting point for RESTful API projects that takes care of setting up
environments, development patterns, users, and authentication in ways that make
it easy to change and write high quality, reliable code.

**Work in Progress.** The rest of this README lays out the vision for this

## Why this exists

While “it depends” is almost always the _really_ correct answer in software
development, I find that 9 times out of 10,
[API-first development](https://www.postman.com/api-first/) is the way to go
(and when I _think_ I’m in that 10th time, that usually means that I haven’t
thought about it hard enough and it turns out that API-first is _still_ the way
to go). This means that, at the start of most projects, I keep doing the same
thing over and over again: setting up Docker, the database, the continuous
deployment pipeline, creating endpoints for users and OAuth authorization and
authentication and **sweet Christmas I just want to get to my project!**

That’s why I wrote this: to handle that once more and never again. From now on,
this is where my projects start. It’s a head start with reasonable values for
all the parts I find myself doing over and over again, written in such a way
that it should be easy to change in those rare projects where I want something
different.

And if you’re looking for the same things that _I’m_ looking for in a good API,
then maybe it’ll be a good starting point for _your_ project, too.

## Principles

Your first question is probably that one: _are_ you looking for the same things
in an API? Well, here’s what _I’m_ looking for:

- **[Test-driven development (TDD)](https://testdriven.io/test-driven-development/):**
  Getting started with test-driven development can be a pain. You have to get
  your testing environment set up properly, and it always helps to have some
  examples of how to actually design for testability and how to write some of
  those tests.
- **[RESTful architecture](https://restfulapi.net/):** Too often, “RESTful” is
  mistaken to mean delivering JSON over HTTPS. This starter API takes the six
  guiding principles of REST seriously (even
  [HATEOAS](https://restfulapi.net/hateoas/)). It implements
  [JSON:API v1.1](https://jsonapi.org/). It uses endpoints, methods, and
  response codes deliberately and thoughtfully.
- **[Built to change](https://youtu.be/l1Efy4RB_kw?si=_-6Z739GYnbqFcLC):** A
  whole bunch of tiny functions and classes makes code easy to change. When we
  make it easy to embrace change, we can
  [fundamentally shift what software development means](https://uxdesign.cc/embracing-change-with-system-driven-design-55668dc6c88e).
  That’s critical in _any_ software project, but it’s doubly true for a starter
  project like this one. This starter API leans into its middleware architecture
  to break things down into a collection of small, reusable utility functions
  and middlewares.

Of course, this is only a _starter_ API. On each of these points, this project
can only provide a _good start_. It will only matter to you if you continue
these practices in your own work. But if these are things that you already value
in your own work, then this can provide a valuable head-start for your API.

## Implementation Details

This starter API is built with:

- 🦕 [Deno](https://deno.com/)
- 🔥️ [Hono](https://hono.dev/)
- 🐘 [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- 🐋 [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- 🐻 [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)

### Authentication

This is the real heart of what the starter API offers, and the main reason you’d
bother with it, as opposed to just starting your own API from scratch. This
starter assumes that you _don’t_ want to get into the business of keeping
passwords around. This is built with the assumption that a client is going to
handle the business of going back and forth between an end user and an OAuth 2.0
provider to get an access or ID token (depending on the provider). This API
provides the following endpoints to handle authentication:

#### `POST /auth/tokens`

You start by making a request to this endpoint, passing the access or ID token
that you got from the provider (as `token`) and a string identifying what
provider it came from (as `provider`). Right now, the starter API supports
Google, GitHub, and Discord. If you’d like to add another, feel free to
[file an enhancement request](https://github.com/jefgodesky/api-starter/issues/new?labels=enhancement).

If the access or ID token checks out, this endpoint looks for a matching account
(e.g., a Google account with the matching Google ID). If there isn’t one, it
creates a new user, creates a new account for the Google login and attaches it
to that new user, and creates a new token. If one already exists, then it just
creates a new token for that user. It sends that token back as a JWT that you
can use with Bearer authentication to other API requests. This token remains
valid for 10 minutes (this is configurable; you can make it longer or shorter,
but it’s generally not advisable to make this last longer than 15 minutes).

You can also use this endpoint by sending it your JWT (as `token`; no `provider`
when you use it this way) to get a new JWT. This works for up to 7 days after
your original OAuth authorization. Like the token expiration, this is
configurable, so you can make it longer or shorter, depending on your security
needs.

#### `POST /accounts`

`POST /auth/tokens` would be sufficient if you were OK with one user account for
your Google login, a second for your GitHub login, and a third for your Discord
login, but it seems likely that at least some of your users will want to log in
to the same account regardless of which provider they use. At the very least,
there’s me, _I’m_ that user. That’s where `POST /accounts` comes in.

This works a lot like `POST /auth/tokens` on the surface: just like that
endpoint, you’re sending it a `provider` and a `token`. Unlike that endpoint,
you have to also send your JWT to this request as Bearer authentication. It
still validates the token with the provider. If it checks out, rather than
making a new user, it makes a new account and attaches it to _your_ account.
That means that the next time you use `POST /auth/tokens`, you can pass an OAuth
access token from that provider and it will connect it to the account you
registered and send back a JWT for your existing user account.

#### `DELETE /accounts/{provider}`

This endpoint allows an authenticated user to remove an OAuth provider account
from her user account. Yes, a user could succeed in completely locking herself
out of her user account this way. We recommend clients use the `GET /accounts`
endpoint to check which accounts a user has and either warn the user before she
accidentally locks herself out or disallows that behavior entirely.

### Roles & Permissions

In the `/roles` directory, you’ll find a `README.md` file explaining the
permissions that are used in the starter API. I wrote this with future
extensibility in mind, so I think continuing this pattern through the rest of
your API would be a good idea!

In the same directory is `perms.yml`, which define the user roles and what
permissions they have. This starts off with the roles that _I_ generally use in
_my_ projects, but it should be easy enough to define new roles as needed this
way.

The `default` setting in `perms.yml` lists which roles are given to users when
they are created. The `roles` setting defines the roles in the system.

| Role        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `anonymous` | This is the role that’s applied to unauthenticated users. Use this to define the permissions that everyone has.                                                                              |
| `active`    | Users need this role in order to authenticate. You can lock problem users out of the system by revoking this role.                                                                           |
| `listed`    | This role is used to mark users who are included in public listings. Revoking this role would hide them. For example, `GET /users/{userId}` would come back 404 when requesting such a user. |
| `admin`     | This role gets the `*` permission, giving her the ability to do literally _anything_. This is the superuser role.                                                                            |

Permissions are applied using the `requirePermissions` middleware, defined in
`middlewares/require/permissions.ts`. There, you will find that it brings
together several permissions functions found in `utils/permissions/*.ts` which
check if given permissions are satisfied. You can see some examples of the
`requirePermissions` middleware in use in the users router in
`collections/users/router.ts`. `requirePermissions('user:update')` will call the
next middleware if the user making the request has the `user:update` permission,
throw a 401 HTTP error if the request is being made by an unauthenticated user,
or throw a 403 HTTP error if the request is being made by an authenticated user
who just doesn’t have the permissions necessary.

If you pass multiple permissions to `requirePermissions`, they are applied using
`AND` logic, meaning that a user only meets the requirements if she meets _all_
of the requirements specified.

### Error Handling

The `handleError` middleware (found in `middlewares/handle-errors.ts`) catches
HTTP errors, packages them as error objects that meet the JSON:API v1.1
specification, and returns them to the user. That means that throughout your own
middlewares, you can throw errors using `HTTPException` from
`hono/http-exception`. Take a look at the `requireClient` middleware (found in
`middlewares/require/client.ts`) for an example of usage.

```typescript
import { HTTPException } from 'hono/http-exception'
import localize from '../../utils/get-message.ts'

const requireClient: Middleware = async (c, next) => {
  if (!c.client) {
    throw new HTTPException(401, localize('authentication_required'))
  }
  await next()
}

export default requireClient
```

`localize` is a utility method that handles microcopy like error messages (kept
in `messages.yml`), which should make internationalization a bit easier if you
ever have to deal with that.

### Docker Containers

You’ll find two Docker Compose configuration files:

- `env/dev.yml` (for the development environment) and
- `env/test.yml` (for the testing environment)

In the development environment, your containers are:

| Container  | Notes                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `postgres` | The PostgreSQL container. This container runs your database. |
| `api`      | The container that actually runs your API.                   |

You can spin up the development environment by running:

```shell
deno run start
```

And spin it down by running:

```shell
deno run stop
```

The data in your database is kept in a volume called `NETWORK_dev_db`, so as
long as that volume is maintained, your data will persist.

The test environment adds one more container:

| Container | Notes                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tests`   | This container waits for the API to become available, and then runs your tests. |

### Environment & Configuration

Both environments have two `.env` files associated with them: `.api.env`, which
is passed to the `api` container, and `.postgres.env`, which is passed to both
the `api` and the `postgres` containers. These files allow you to configure a
great deal about your API. We recommend that you continue this pattern by adding
your own configuration options here as well.

| File            | Variable             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.postgres.env` | `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`  | The password for your PostgreSQL database. The container will create a database with this password.                                                                                                                                        |
| `.postgres.env` | `POSTGRES_USER`      | The username for your PostgreSQL database. The container will create a user with this username and a database with the same name.                                                                                                          |
| `.postgres.env` | `POSTGRES_DB`        | The name of your PostgreSQL database. The container won’t automatically create this (unless it’s identical to `POSTGRES_USER`), so if you want a database with a different name, you’ll have some extra configuration work to do.          |
| `.postgres.env` | `POSTGRES_HOST`      | The host of your PostgreSQL server. This should match the name of your container.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `.postgres.env` | `POSTGRES_PORT`      | The port that the PostgreSQL server is listening on.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `.postgres.env` | `POSTGRES_POOLS`     | The number of pools that the PostgreSQL database will allow at any given time.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `.postgres.env` | `TOKEN_EXPIRATION`   | An expression of how long a token (JWT) should be valid for. The default is `10 minutes`. You could be introducing security concerns if you make this much higher than 15 minutes.                                                         |
| `.postgres.env` | `REFRESH_EXPIRATION` | An expression of how long after the original OAuth authorization a user should be allowed to refresh an old token. The default is `7 days`.                                                                                                |
| `.api.env`      | `API_VERSION`        | The version of the API. Changing this will change every endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `.api.env`      | `API_DOMAIN`         | The domain that the API is hosted on.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `.api.env`      | `API_PROTOCOL`       | This can be `http` or `https`. For development, this is set to `http`, but any API in development _should_ be set to `https`.                                                                                                              |
| `.api.env`      | `PORT`               | The port that the API is listening for requests on.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `.api.env`      | `IS_TEST`            | Set to `true` in the testing environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `.api.env`      | `JWT_SECRET`         | The secret used to sign and verify your JWTs. If this leaks, your API’s security is compromised. Keep it secret, keep it safe. This is probably the biggest reason why you should _**NEVER**_ commit your `.env` files to your repository! |
| `.api.env`      | `MAX_PAGE_SIZE`      | The maximum number of items that can appear on a single page (in paginated results).                                                                                                                                                       |
| `.api.env`      | `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`  | The number of items that appears on a single page if the request doesn’t specify (in paginated results).                                                                                                                                   |
| `.api.env`      | `LANG`               | The language from which microcopy (e.g., error messages) are pulled.                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Running Tests

To run your tests, run:

```shell
deno run test
```

This spins up the testing environment, runs your tests, prints out the results,
then spins down the testing environment.

If there’s a problem with an integration test, it _might_ be something that’s
only visible from _within the API_, meaning that errors being thrown or
information being logged to the console are showing up in the `api` container,
not the `tests` container. When that happens, you’ll see the tests failing, but
the critical information about _why_ will only show up in the logs from the
`api` container. Most of the time, `./test.sh` cleaning up after itself is a
great convenience, but in specific situations like this it requires you to get a
little deeper under the hood. When this happens you can run:

```shell
docker compose -f test.yml up --build -d
```

This will run the tests, but the testing environment will remain up afterwards,
including the `api` container, so you can check its logs or conduct other
experiments to see what went wrong. When you’re done, you’ll have to spin the
test environment down manually by running:

```shell
docker compose -f test.yml down
```

### Deploying

To deploy your API, you’ll want to create the following files:

- `env/prod.yml`
- `env/prod.postgres.env`
- `env/prov.api.env`

The `dev` version of each of these files is a good starting point, but make sure
that you replace them with production-ready configuration options.

I usually host my projects on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), so
the starter comes with a GitHub Actions workflow in
`.github/workflows/release.yml` which fire when I make a new release and deploys
the project to a DigitalOcean droplet defined in my repository secrets. If you
also use DigitalOcean, this should work out pretty well for you, too. If not, it
might be a starting point that you can amend to match your own production
deployment needs.

## Getting Started

If this sounds like something that could be useful to you, that’s great! Click
the green **Use this template** button above to create your own copy of this
repository.

- You’ll want to update a lot of the header information in `docs/index.yml` to
  describe _your_ project, rather than a generic starter API.
- In each of the Docker Compose configuration files (found in `env/*.yml`),
  you’ll want to update the name to reflect your project (e.g.,
  `api_starter_dev` to `my_project_dev`).

If you’re looking for a step-by-step example of how to get started using this to
handle CRUD operations, check out the
[To Do API example](https://github.com/jefgodesky/api-starter-todo) and
[the accompanying tutorial](https://medium.com/@jason.godesky/jumpstarting-a-new-restful-api-ef4cc553e809).

## Contributing

There’s a number of ways to contribute to this project. The simplest is to just
[file an issue](https://github.com/jefgodesky/api-starter/issues), whether
that’s a bug you found, an improvement you think I could make, or an enhancement
you’d like to see.

If you’d like to fork this for your own projects, you have my blessing. That’s
kind of the whole point of releasing it as a template, but even if you want to
fork this to make your own, rival template, by all means, have at it. Maybe I’ll
use _your_ starter for my next project _instead_ of this.

But if you’d like to contribute directly to this code,
[pull requests](https://github.com/jefgodesky/api-starter/compare) are always
welcome.
